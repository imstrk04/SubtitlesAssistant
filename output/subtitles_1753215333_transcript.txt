Can I ask a question? Of course you can. 
Speaker 02:
Can 
Speaker 01:

Speaker 02:
I'm afraid I'm of no use to you there. Why 
Speaker 01:
couldn't they put me in a proper prison? 
Speaker 02:
A better facility wasn't available. Put me in a madhouse? 
Speaker 01:
It's secure training centre. Training? 
Speaker 02:
What are they training us 
Speaker 01:
for? The other boys are screaming all the time. I had been 
Speaker 02:
explained to And the rock backwards and forwards and the shower at current 
Speaker 01:
age is free. Young institutions have got 15 
Speaker 02:

Speaker 01:
It's mad in here, you don't understand. This was the best place for you to Ryan gets to 
Speaker 02:
stay at home until his trial. Ryan isn't accused of

It's all accused. If I did it, 
Speaker 01:
if I hurt her, then I get it, but I didn't, 
Speaker 02:
so... I it, Jamie, and this wasn't my decision. This was the best place for you to

Speaker 01:
If you don't sit down... Does that mean you don't know 
Speaker 02:

Speaker 01:
You need to sit down. I don't want to sit down. If you don't 
Speaker 02:

You do not tell me when to sit down! 
Speaker 01:
You do not control what I 
Speaker 02:
fucking... Look at me now! 
Speaker 01:
You do not 
Speaker 02:
control what I do in my life! Get 
Speaker 01:
that in that fucking little head of yours! 
Speaker 02:
Fucking hell!
