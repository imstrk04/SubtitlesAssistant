1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
[Speaker 01] Can I ask a question? Of course you can.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,256
[Speaker 02] Can

3
00:00:04,256 --> 00:00:06,272
[Speaker 01] you get me out of this place?

4
00:00:06,272 --> 00:00:08,288
[Speaker 02] I'm afraid I'm of no use to you there. Why

5
00:00:08,288 --> 00:00:10,304
[Speaker 01] couldn't they put me in a proper prison?

6
00:00:10,304 --> 00:00:12,928
[Speaker 02] A better facility wasn't available. Put me in a madhouse?

7
00:00:12,928 --> 00:00:14,944
[Speaker 01] It's secure training centre. Training?

8
00:00:14,944 --> 00:00:17,184
[Speaker 02] What are they training us

9
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:19,903
[Speaker 01] for? The other boys are screaming all the time. I had been

10
00:00:19,903 --> 00:00:21,984
[Speaker 02] explained to And the rock backwards and forwards and the shower at current

11
00:00:21,984 --> 00:00:24,224
[Speaker 01] age is free. Young institutions have got 15

12
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:26,847
[Speaker 02] up. One kid goes nuts every time you see Steve McDonald.

13
00:00:26,847 --> 00:00:30,463
[Speaker 01] It's mad in here, you don't understand. This was the best place for you to Ryan gets to

14
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:32,671
[Speaker 02] stay at home until his trial. Ryan isn't accused of

15
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:34,688
[Speaker 01] such a serious crime. Accused?

16
00:00:34,688 --> 00:00:36,991
[Speaker 02] It's all accused. If I did it,

17
00:00:36,991 --> 00:00:39,167
[Speaker 01] if I hurt her, then I get it, but I didn't,

18
00:00:39,167 --> 00:00:42,783
[Speaker 02] so... I it, Jamie, and this wasn't my decision. This was the best place for you to

19
00:00:42,783 --> 00:00:46,816
[Speaker 01] be. Nothing has been decided yet. Do know where it's going to be? London or somewhere local? You

20
00:00:46,816 --> 00:00:48,832
[Speaker 02] need to sit down, Jamie.

21
00:00:48,832 --> 00:00:51,103
[Speaker 01] If you don't sit down... Does that mean you don't know

22
00:00:51,103 --> 00:00:53,439
[Speaker 02] what you just want to tell me? Nothing's been decided yet.

23
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:56,159
[Speaker 01] You need to sit down. I don't want to sit down. If you don't

24
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:58,719
[Speaker 02] sit down, I have to stop this discussion. Maybe I want you to. Do

25
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,896
[Speaker 01] you? It'd piss you off, that, wouldn't it?

26
00:01:00,896 --> 00:01:02,911
[Speaker 02] You'd have to go home and then come back again.

27
00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:06,560
[Speaker 01] Jamie, if you do not sit... Look how fucking what I sit down!

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,536
[Speaker 02] You do not tell me when to sit down!

29
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:11,871
[Speaker 01] You do not control what I

30
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:13,888
[Speaker 02] fucking... Look at me now!

31
00:01:13,888 --> 00:01:15,903
[Speaker 01] You do not

32
00:01:15,903 --> 00:01:17,920
[Speaker 02] control what I do in my life! Get

33
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,936
[Speaker 01] that in that fucking little head of yours!

34
00:01:19,936 --> 00:01:22,239
[Speaker 02] Fucking hell!
